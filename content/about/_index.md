Kaoto is a **Ka**mel **O**rchestration **To**ol.

The user interface have both a source code text editor and a drag and drop graphical space to edit integrations. When a change is done in one of them, the other gets updated automatically. This way users can work both no-code and low-code at the same time as an alternative to the traditional IDE.

Kaoto supports kamelet bindings as the source code because of the simplicity of working with them as deployments of the integrations. We intend to extend that support to other types of Apache Camel ways to deploy routes, like XML routes. 

Kaoto is an extendable cloud-native Apache Camel interface to handle integrations for low-code and no-code personas.
