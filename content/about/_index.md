Kaoto is an acronym for **Ka**mel **O**rchestration **To**ol. Kaoto is a low code and no code integration designer to edit and deploy based on [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/). It is designed to be extendable and flexible and adaptable to different usecases. [You can find statistics and history of Kaoto here](/timeline).

The user interface has both a source code editor and a drag and drop graphical editor. When a change is done in one of them, the other gets updated automatically. This way users can choose to work both no-code or low-code.

Kaoto can load catalogs of building blocks from different sources. By default, Kaoto supports the official [Kamelet catalog](https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets). There is also a [growing support for Camel connectors](https://github.com/KaotoIO/camel-component-metadata). You can configure your own catalog of steps (using the official Kamelet catalog or using your own).

The Kaoto team is also working on full [support for cloud-native Apache Camel deployments via Camel-K](https://github.com/KaotoIO/kaoto-backend/issues/10).
