Kaoto is an acronym for **Ka**mel **O**rchestration **To**ol. Kaoto is a low code and no code integration designer to create and edit integrations based on [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/). It is designed to be extendable and flexible and adaptable to different usecases. [You can find statistics and history of Kaoto here](/timeline).

The user interface has both a source code editor and a drag and drop graphical editor. When a change is done in one of them, the other gets updated automatically on saving. This way users can choose to work both no-code or low-code.

Kaoto offers a rich catalog of building blocks for use in the graphical designer. By default, Kaoto supports the official upstream [Camel Catalog](https://camel.apache.org/components/next/) as well as the official [Kamelet catalog](https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets). In future we also want to offer configuring your own catalog of steps and to also configure the Apache Camel version to be used.
