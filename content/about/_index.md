Kaoto is the next generation integration designer to easily edit and deploy automations and integrations for low-code and no-code personas.

Kaoto is an acronym for **Ka**mel **O**rchestration **To**ol.

The user interface have both a source code text editor and a drag and drop graphical space to edit workflows. When a change is done in one of them, the other gets updated automatically. This way users can work both no-code and low-code at the same time as an alternative to the traditional IDE.

Kaoto supports by default kamelet bindings and kamelet definitions because of the simplicity of working with them as deployments of the integrations. Kaoto can support multiple Domain Specific Languages (DSL) as described in [the documentation](/docs/add_dsl).

Kaoto is supports cloud-native Apache Camel deployments via Camel-K.
