We have a new pre-release version v0.2.0 of Kaoto with a fancy refactored editor!

## How to test it

You can test this new Kaoto v0.2.0 with the following commands:

```
docker run --rm -d -p 8081:8081 --name kaoto-backend kaotoio/backend:0.2.0 
docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080 --name kaoto-frontend kaotoio/frontend:0.2.0
```

And you can open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to use Kaoto.


Always stop the containers when finishing using Kaoto so you don't have containers dangling:

```
docker stop kaoto-backend
docker stop kaoto-frontend
```
