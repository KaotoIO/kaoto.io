This marks the first major release for Kaoto. üçæ  Kaoto is an open source visual integration and workflow editor. It supports multiple DSLs and advanced integration capabilities for both developers and non-developers.

Kaoto was built to be extended, and it gives you a layer of abstraction where you can store catalogs of steps/actions and custom configuration views for those steps/actions outside of Kaoto.

In this 1.0.0 release, we focused on supporting [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) DSLs, such as [Camel Route in YAML DSL](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.11.x/languages/yaml.html), [Kamelet](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.12.x/kamelets/kamelets-user.html), [KameletBinding](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.12.x/kamelets/kamelets-user.html#kamelets-usage-binding) and [Integration](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/1.12.x/running/running.html#no-cli-integration).

## Give it a try!
