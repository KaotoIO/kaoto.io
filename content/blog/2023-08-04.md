## What is happening and why?

Kaoto was already a great [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) editor, but we were facing some challenges we want to address.

The first thing we want to address is the separation between backend and frontend. With [Camel K,](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k) [Camel JBang](https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-jbang.html) and other tools available for deployment, we decided to put the focus on the editor for Kaoto.

Another thing we want to change is the internal data model. In Kaoto v1 the backend was translating the different DSLs into a generic UI oriented model before sending it to the frontend. The UI model tried to be agnostic to offer the possibility to support other types of DSLs than [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) ones. This was introducing additional challenges when working on very Camel specific features.

So long story short, while we don't intend to close the door for other types of DSLs, we want to focus on providing the best experience possible for working with [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/).

## What comes next?

We will work on a new major version of Kaoto (v2), which will be a frontend only [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) Integration Editor. The goal is to leverage the [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) models and schemas as direct as possible. For the new Kaoto frontend we will leverage the latest technology stack and then port functionalities from Kaoto v1 as much as possible while avoiding the issues we have seen in v1. 

**Stay tuned! We expect to have a first version of Kaoto v2 in Q1/2024.**
