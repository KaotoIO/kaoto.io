## It's time to celebrate the 2.0.0 release of Kaoto

With this 2.0.0 release we finished implementing the foundational functionalities for an [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) visual editor. Kaoto will guide you with the creation of new and the editing of existing [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) integrations. Together with the other extensions of the [Extension Pack for Apache Camel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.apache-camel-extension-pack) it offers functionality from the creation over the local execution with the [Apache Camel CLI](https://camel.apache.org/manual/camel-jbang.html) to even the deployment to your cluster.

This release is just the beginning for Kaoto! We have [so many exciting features and improvements](https://github.com/orgs/KaotoIO/projects/14/views/2) in the works, and we're eagerly inviting anyone who wants to join us on this journey. Let's all hop on this Camel ride together! üê´üéâ
