#With this 2.0.0 TP1 (Tech Preview) release we open up a new chapter for the Kaoto project. We leveraged all the strengths of Kaoto v1 and used the time to use the upstream [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) models and schemas directly, which will ensure that we provide the latest features of [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) in Kaoto. In addition we managed to add new features and usability improvements while also trying to keep most of the functionality of Kaoto v1.

## Features

* Expression definition support
* Dataformat support
* Support for adding Beans from the Canvas Configuration Form
