**We are happy to announce the release of Kaoto 2.0.0 TP2 (Tech Preview 2).** 

We strive to make Kaoto a top choice when it comes to working with [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) integrations. To achieve that we continuously add new features and enhancements to make the integration developer's life easier and closely collaborate with the [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) project.

## New Features

#### Camel routes configuration
We added root containers for Camel Routes and Kamelets, so you can configure their behavior.

#### Support for Kamelet Beans
Added support for Kamelet Beans using the Form.

#### Kamelet configuration
Included a custom form to configure the most common aspects of a Kamelet easily.

#### Dropdown placeholders
Users can now enter placeholders in drop-down boxes, enhancing flexibility in defining component configurations.


## UX Improvements

#### Sticky Configuration Form header
We‚Äôve made the form title sticky to ensure a better experience while scrolling through options.

#### Sticky Catalog filter controls
Now the catalog‚Äôs filter sticks to the top, so the selected filter is always visible.

#### Catalog filter counts
When searching for a component or a pattern, we included the result count from other categories as well, so we can see what‚Äôs available at a glance

#### Sorted Patterns and Components parameters
For ease of navigation, patterns parameters,  and component parameters are now sorted by the Catalog index.

#### Consistent Field Spacing
We've improved field spacing across different components for a cleaner and more consistent look.

## Bug Fixes

* The form scroll bar is outside of the form, to avoid colliding with the form controls
* Empty objects `{}` are not persisted in the source code
* Fix typos in the Bean and OnException definitions upstream ([CAMEL-20462](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-20462))
