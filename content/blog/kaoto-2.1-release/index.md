## It's time to welcome the 2.1.0 release of Kaoto

For this 2.1.0 release we focused on improving the overall user experience as well as introducing new features. One of the highlights of this release is the ability to select between different Camel versions. You still miss some Camel versions? We enable you to [create your own](https://github.com/KaotoIO/kaoto/blob/main/packages/catalog-generator/README.md) Catalog library with the versions you want to use.

## Give it a try

* Kaoto [quickstart](/docs/quickstart/).
* Kaoto is available as a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-kaoto).
* Kaoto [showcase deployment](https://red.ht/kaoto).

## Features & Improvements

* Introduced support for multiple Apache Camel versions
* A new filter field in the configuration panel that lets you easily find the parameter you are looking for
* A resizable configuration panel
* Grouping of EIP / Processor properties
* Several other small enhancements and bug fixes
