On the following video we can see how to do a no code integration and deploy it in a cluster via Camel K.

First we start a new integration by selecting the first step, which is going to be a timer. This timer is going to send a message to the following step. Then we select the second step from the mini catalog. On this case, we are selecting a log step, that will just log the message sent from the previous step. 

Finally we are going to deploy using the triangle button representing a "start". We could afterwards stop the integration by clicking on the "stop" button.
