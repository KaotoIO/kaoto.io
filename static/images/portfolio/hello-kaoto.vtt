00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.001
What I'm going to show you here is

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.320
how to do a simple hello world integration

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.840
that gets deployed via Camel K

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.840
into a kubernetes cluster.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.852
 

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:12.852
So the first thing we need to do is

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:14.852
start a new integration and then

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:16.852
we are going to select

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:20.000
the first step, which is going to be a timer.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This timer is going to 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
throw a message to the integration [route]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.320
every second.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800
We configure that message by going  to the config.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.800
Write, for example, "Hello Kaoto!".

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.280
You can see how it gets updated on the YAML.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.000
And then we are going to select the second step,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is going to be the last step,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.162
which is going to be a log.

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.477
It's going to log the headers

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.800
and the message that is coming from the timer.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.972
We want to do a Kamelet Binding

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:50.179
and we change the integration name

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.136
"hello-kaoto" for example.

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:56.190
And now we are going to watch the integrations

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.110
and the Kamelet Bindings that are deployed on the cluster,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.179
which right now is none of them.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.144
The Kamelet Binding is the same integration type we are deploying.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:07.920
We click on deploy and now we have a Kamelet Binding

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.242
which is creating an integration via Camel K.

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:14.600
If we watch the logs on this "hello-kaoto" integration,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.593
well, right now it is going to say it is still building;

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:21.124
so we have to wait a few seconds while the Building Kit gets build and

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.120
the integration gets deployed.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.514
And once it gets deployed,

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:30.665
it will show the "Hello Kaoto" message

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:33.061
and the headers on the log.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.416
This is starting... and...

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:40.640
we can see that every second we get a "Hello Kaoto!" message here.
